# main.js explained

## 1.  5 variables are assigned with certain values for calculating curve vertex.
## 2.  Setup is given the size of window width and window height and is set to black canvas background.
## 3.  Under the setup function, I created the position of curve vertex with a translate.
## 4.  The stroke of the vertex is set for giving it a definite texture.
## 5.  Loop is created for creating the curve vertex for conditions of "i,j,k" if true.
## 6.  Under the loop, two variables are created using map function for scaling the numbers set in the starting 5 variables to the new number and scale it curve vertex accordingly.
## 7. Further going the other two variables are created for multiplying variables "ang" and "rad" which are further used to plot curve vertex.
## 8. Begin shape and end shape was created for packing function and display.
## 9. The second curve vertex is given values accordingly to not show it. If taken out, 1st and 3rd vertexes merge.
## 10. At last timeout, the function is set for reloading page every 5 seconds.
